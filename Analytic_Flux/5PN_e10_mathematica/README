 Instruction for the 5PN O(e^{10}) data files for Mathematica
 Created on Aug. 26 2020
 (These files have been converted from Maple files.)
========================================================

This directory contains the post-Newtonian (PN) formulas for 
the adiabatic change of the constants of motion and the orbital 
parameters due to gravitational waves radiated from a compact 
star of mass $\mu$ in eccentric and inclined orbits around a Kerr 
black hole (BH) of mass $M$ to the 5PN order and the tenth order 
in eccentricity. These formulas are derived in Ref.[1] and 
are extensions of Ref.[2].

========
Notation
========
We use the following notation in the data files.
For details please see Ref.[2].

q : dimensionless spin parameter of the Kerr BH
p : semi-latus rectum
e : orbital eccentricity
iota : orbital inclination angle

v = sqrt(1/p) : typical orbital velocity
Y = cos(iota) : cosine of the inclination angle
kappa = sqrt(1-q^2)

Pi = 3.1415926...
gamma = 0.57721... : Euler's constant

 dIdt_5PN_e10.mx
=================
This file gives the adiabatic change of the constants of motion, 
dI/dt where I=(E,L,C), at 5PN and O(e^{10}). The list of the included 
data is as follows:

* dEdtN, dLdtN, dCdtN :
These variables are the leading order expressions of the adiabatic 
change of (E,L,C). 

* dEdt8corr, dLdt8corr, dCdt8corr :
These variables are the corrections of dI/dt from the leading order
expressions associated with the gravitational waves emitted to the
infinity. For example, one obtains the formula of dE/dt^\infty as

dE/dt^\infty = dEdtN * dEdt8corr.

* dEdtHcorr, dLdtHcorr, dCdtHcorr :
These variables are the corrections of dI/dt from the leading order 
expressions associated with the gravitational waves absorbed into
the central black hole. For example, one obtains the formula of
dE/dt^H as

dE/dt^H = dEdtN * dEdtHcorr.

=================
 dJdt_5PN_e10.mx
=================
This file gives the adiabatic change of the orbital parameters, 
dJ/dt where J=(v,e,Y), at 5PN and O(e^{10}). It should be noted 
that the relative orders of the accuracy in de/dt and dY/dt are 
reduced due to the cancellations in calculating them from dE/dt, 
dL/dt and dC/dt, as explained in Ref.[1]. In the current results, 
the relative order of the accuracy in de/dt with respect to 
the eccentricity becomes O(e^8) effectively. The relative PN order 
in dY/dt is redueced to 3.5PN. The list of the included data is as follows:

* dvdtN, dedtN, dYdtN :
These variables are the leading order expressions of the adiabatic 
change of (v,e,Y). 

* dvdt8corr, dedt8corr, dYdt8corr :
These variables are the corrections of dJ/dt from the leading order
expressions associated with the gravitational waves emitted to 
the infinity. For example, one obtains the formula of dv/dt^\infty as

dv/dt^\infty = dvdtN * dvdt8corr.

* dvdtHcorr, dedtHcorr, dYdtHcorr :
These variables are the corrections of dJ/dt from the leading order
expressions associated with the gravitational waves absorbed 
into the central black hole. For example, one obtains the formula 
of dv/dt^H as

dv/dt^H = dvdtN * dvdtHcorr.
